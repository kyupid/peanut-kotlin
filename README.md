심심해서 배워보는 심심푸리 땅콩틀린🥜

### 1. final in JAVA VS open in Kotlin
**final method in Java**: A method that cannot be overridden.

**final class in Java**: A class that cannot be extended.

Open classes and methods in Kotlin are equivalent to the opposite of final in Java, 
an open method is overridable and an open class is extendable in Kotlin.

요약: final 이 하는 역할의 딱 반대역할
질문: 왜 이런 장치를 만들었을까?
